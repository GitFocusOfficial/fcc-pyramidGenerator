# Learn Introductory JavaScript by Building a Pyramid Generator

JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that you can use to make web pages interactive. It's one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS. All modern browsers support JavaScript.

In this practice project, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding your own Pyramid Generator. You'll learn how to work with arrays, strings, functions, loops, `if/else` statements, and more.

## Step 1

JavaScript is the programming language that powers the web. Unlike the HTML and CSS you have learned previously, JavaScript is most commonly used to write logic instead of markup.

In this project, you will learn the basics of Javascript and apply those concepts to building a pyramid generator.

A pyramid generator is a program where you can set the type of character, the count for the pyramid, and the direction of the pyramid. The program will then generate a pyramid based on those inputs.

## Step 2

One of the most important concepts in programming is variables. A *variable* points to a specific memory address that stores a value. Variables are given a name which can be used throughout your code to access that value.

Declaring a variable means giving it a name. In JavaScript, this is often done with the `let` keyword. For example, here is how you would declare a `hello` variable:

>Example Code
>
>```let
>let hello;
>```

Variable naming follows specific rules: names can include letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores, but cannot contain spaces and must not begin with a number.

>Use the `let` keyword to declare a variable called `character`.

Note: It is common practice to end statements in JavaScript with a semicolon. `;`

## Step 3

Your `character` variable currently does not have a value. You can assign a value using the assignment operator `=`. For example:

>Example Code
>
>```let
>let hello = "Hello";
>```

Assigning a value to a variable at the moment of its declaration is known as *initialization*.

Initialize your `character` variable by assigning it the value `"Hello"` during its declaration.
